         Consequentialism is a kind of moral theory that  assesses things – actions, persons, policies, and institutions – by the value of their consequences.  Utilitarians are consequentialists with a welfarist theory of value, that is, who focus on welfare, well-being, or happiness as the relevant consequence.  There are a number of different theoretical choices to be made within the consequentialist and utilitarian families, especially about how to understand value and how to understand the function from value to duty or obligation. Different conceptions of utilitarianism result from different conceptions of happiness or well-being.  Some, such as Jeremy Bentham (1748-1832), interpret happiness in  subjective terms as consisting in or depending importantly upon the person’s contingent and variable psychological states.  For instance, hedonism claims that happiness consists in pleasure and the 
absence of pain.  Pleasure might be thought of as a qualitatively homogenous mental state or sensation or, alternatively, as any mental state or sensation that one wants to continue and will, 
ceteris paribus, take steps to prolong.  Similarly, pain might be thought of as a qualitatively homogeneous mental state or sensation or, alternatively, as any mental state or sensation that one
            dislikes and will, ceteris paribus, take steps to discontinue.  Others construe happiness as consisting in the satisfaction of actual or idealized desire.  <br/><br/>  Still others conceive of happiness or welfare in more objective terms as consisting in perfection (e.g. the realization of one’s essential capacities) or some list of objective goods (e.g. knowledge, achievement, friendship).

      <h2>Kitesurfing</h2>
      <p> Kitesurfing is a sport in which you use a kite to capture wind power and ride a wakeboard-like baord over water.  From Wikipedia: <br/> <blockquote> "Kitesurfing or kiteboarding is a surface water sport combining aspects of wakeboarding, windsurfing, surfing, paragliding, and gymnastics into one extreme sport. A kitesurfer or kiteboarder harnesses the power of the wind with a large controllable power kite to be propelled across the water on a kiteboard similar to a wakeboard or a small surfboard, with or without foot-straps or bindings. The terms kiteboarding and kitesurfing are interchangeable." </blockquote> <br/> It is very entertaining, and I recommend it very much.</p>
      
      <h2>Snow Kiting</h2>
      <p> Snow kiting is a similar sport, but instead of over water participants travel over snow.  From Wikipedia: <br/> <blockquote> Snowkiting or Kite boarding is an outdoor winter sport where people use kite power to glide on snow or ice. The sport is similar to kitesurfing, but with the footwear used in snowboarding or skiing. In the early days of snowkiting, foil kites were the most common type; nowadays some kitesurfers use their water gear such as inflatable kites. Snowkiting differs from other alpine sports in that it is possible for the snowkiter to travel uphill and downhill with any wind direction. Like kitesurfing, snowkiting can be very hazardous and should be learned and practiced with care. Snowkiting is becoming increasingly popular in places often associated with skiing and snowboarding, such as Russia, Canada, Iceland, France, Switzerland, Austria, Norway, Sweden and the Northern and Central United States. The sport is becoming more diverse as adventurers use kites to travel great distances and sports enthusiasts push the boundaries of freestyle, big air, speed and back country exploration. </blockquote> <br/> I have not been snow kiting, but there is a <a href="http://www.sierrasnowkite.com/"> new snowkiting area</a> in Tahoe where I would like to go this winter.</p>
